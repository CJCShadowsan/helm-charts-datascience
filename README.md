# Helm charts Datascience (Deprecated)

There are some news catalogs you must use with Onyxia :
- [Interactives services](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/helm-charts-datascience-internal)
- [Databases](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/helm-charts-databases)
- [Automation](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/helm-charts-automation)

This repository will be archived






This collection of Helm Charts is tailored for datascientists !
It is primarly designed to work with [Onyxia](https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia) but also works as a standalone Helm repository.  
See the other repository ([Helm charts](https://github.com/inseefrlab/helm-charts)) for infrastructure focused charts.  

To use the repo on helm (version 3+) :
```
helm repo add inseefrlab-datascience https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-datascience
```  

The repo is also browsable directly https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-datascience/index.yaml

Contributions are welcome, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests :)
